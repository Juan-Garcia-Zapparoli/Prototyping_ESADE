# üéì Master Finder App ‚Äì Assignment 2 (LLM)

This project is part of **Assignment 2** for the course **Prototyping with LLMs** at ESADE (Second Term, MIBA).  
The goal is to build a functional prototype that uses a **Large Language Model** to assist users in exploring and comparing master's programs across different universities.

---

## üß© What is the utility of the prototype?

The prototype helps prospective students easily search and compare master's programs by centralizing information such as tuition fees, scholarships, duration, and location.  
It simplifies the research process and uses natural language queries to make the experience intuitive and efficient‚Äîespecially useful for international students exploring global options.
